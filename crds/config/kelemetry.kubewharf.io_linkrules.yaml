          LinkRule instructs Kelemetry to display multiple objects (the "source" and the "target") in the same trace
          by looking up the "target" when the span of the "source" object gets created.


          LinkRule is bidirectional.
          Once the link is recorded, searching "source" or "target" would both display the other trace in the link
          as long as the link is not filtered out by tfconfig.
